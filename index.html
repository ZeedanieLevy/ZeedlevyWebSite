            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro</p>
            <br>
            <p>I look up to Cristiano Ronaldo because of his incredible work ethic, determination, and commitment to excellence. He never settles for less and constantly pushes himself to improve, both on and off the field. His discipline, confidence, and drive to be the best inspire me to stay focused on my goals and give my best effort in everything I do.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>When asked how much Lionel Messi has pushed him to become a better player he responded: "I pushed myself, I don't need other players to push myself." He believes he pushes himself by constantly working to improve and asserts that one must think they are the best to achieve strength and success.</p>

            <p>AI-based automated inventory management transforms traditional stock control by using intelligent systems that predict demand, optimize supply, and improve logistics. Unlike rule-based automation, AI adapts to changing conditions, reducing stockouts, cutting costs, and enhancing efficiency. In my world, this technology could streamline operations, especially in retail or distribution, by forecasting seasonal trends, managing stock automatically, and identifying the most efficient delivery routesâ€”saving time and resources while improving customer satisfaction.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              However, ethical issues such as job displacement, data privacy, and over-reliance on AI must be addressed. Companies should ensure transparency, retrain affected workers, and maintain human oversight to prevent unfair or harmful outcomes. A real example of this technology is C3 AI Inventory Optimization <a class="link" href="https://c3.ai/products/c3-ai-inventory-optimization/">C3.ai</a> uses AI to balance stock levels and improve supply chain performance responsibly.
